Jamming app requests Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account

Project Requirements
- Build a web app using React
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Integrate with Spotify or another API
- Deploy your application
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
  - The purpose of your project
  - Technologies used
  - Features
  - Future work


- More specific, the website must have
  1. Authentication with Spotify
    - User Spotify OAuth
    - Get an access token
    - Understand that tokens expire and website must be able to handle that
  2. Search the Spotify library
    - User types a search term
    - App called Spotify's Search API
    - Receive tracks (id, name, artist, album, uri)
  3. Build a custom playlist (client-side first)
    - Add tracks from search results to a playlist
    - Prevent duplicates
    - Remove tracks from the playlist
    - Rename the playlist
  4. Save the playlist to the user's Spotify account
    - Get the user's Spotify user id
    - Create a new playlist via Spotify API
    - Add tracks to that playlist using their URIs
